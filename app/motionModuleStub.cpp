 *
 * This file implements the methods and attributes of the
 * motionModuleStub Class. It is important to note that
 * this is only the stub of the real motionModule Class needed
 * to present the capabilities of the VoiceController Component.
 * The real motionModule Class will need to be integrated
 * with the VoiceController component in the future.
