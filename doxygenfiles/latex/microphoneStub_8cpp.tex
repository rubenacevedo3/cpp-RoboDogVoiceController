This file implements the methods and attributes of the \hyperlink{classmicrophoneStub}{microphone\+Stub} Class. It is important to note that this is only the stub of the real microphone Class needed to present the capabilities of the Voice\+Controller Component. The real microphone Class will need to be integrated with the Voice\+Controller component in the future. The assumption is made that the real microphone Class takes in audio files and outputs them as strings.
