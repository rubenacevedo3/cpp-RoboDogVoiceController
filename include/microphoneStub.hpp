 *@copyright [2017] Ruben Acevedo
 *
 * This file will define the methods and attributes of the
 * microphoneStub Class. It is important to note that
 * this is only the stub of the real microphone Class needed
 * to present the capabilities of the VoiceController Component.
 * The real microphone Class will need to be integrated
 * with the VoiceController component in the future. The assumption
 * is made that the real microphone Class takes in audio files
 * and outputs them as strings.
